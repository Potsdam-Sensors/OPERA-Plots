# OPERA Plots

## Requirements

### Consumer Packages
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`

### `TATools` Custom Package
The `TATools` package contains code to process OPERA CSV data as well as some plotting helpers.

#### Install
The easiest way is to use `pip` and `git`. It may be a good idea to install this package in a separate python environment.

You will need the official [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/install/) installed on your computer and on your `PATH`.


Then, to install from a terminal, you can do:

```bash
python -m pip install git+http://github.com/Potsdam-Sensors/TATools-Python.git
```
